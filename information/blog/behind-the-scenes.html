					<h2>The Cosmic Kitchen</h2>
					Most of the food served in our restaurants is made from scratch on-site, but it's not always prepared in the restaurant you're eating at. Unbeknownst to the thousands of guests visiting daily, there is a massive kitchen hiding behind the futuristic spires of Galaxy Center, infact it's partially located underneath the darkride section of <em>LIGHTSPEED</em>. The Cosmic Kitchen is our central food-prep facility where we transform scratch ingredients into partially made foods, snacks, and treats.
					Though the cooking and final touches are mostly completed at the individual restaurants, prepping food at the Cosmic Kitchen ensures we can serve guests quickly and consistently without compromising flavor and quality. It's one of the few kitchens in Puertas Nuevas where you'll find purple Magic Cat Cupcakes being decorated on a counter next to churroh dough being rolled out next to chicken tenders being breaded next to meatballs being sphere-ified next to... okay you get it, there's all kinds of foods and treats being made here.
					<p>If you've eaten it on resort property, chances are your meal started its journey at the Cosmic Kitchen. But there's more than cooking here, there's also tasting and experimenting. Many of the unique flavors and creative treats you love got their start as a test-item in the Cosmic Kitchen. Our chefs and bakers are encouraged to experiment and try new things and, every couple months, any cast member who wants to participate can visit the Cosmic Kitchen to try these experimental delights and let us know what they think. Based on this data, we might roll out the item to our guests!</p>
					
					<h2>Interior Logistics</h2>
					Interior Logistics is <em>the</em> backbone of Globe-City's Careaway Resort. Ever wondered how we keep our retail shelves stocked? Or how your fav restaurants ensure their kitchens have enough food to serve thousands of guests a day? Well IA is the answer. From the second the parks close, to nearly 5 minutes before opening, a fleet of Interior Logistics trucks are rumbling through the paths you walk during the day delivering food, merchandise, supplies, and more to all our restaurants, stores, office spaces, etc.

					<h2>Resort Laundry Services</h2>
					With five hotels, dozens of restaurants, and over a thousand employees onsite everyday, there is <em>a lot</em> of laundry in hundreds of dirty bins across the property. So how does it all get cleaned? 

					<h2>Resort Operations</h2>
					Located in the large <em>Central Operations</em> (we call it C-ops) office building south of the parks, our Resort Operations team is the network of people responsible for ensuring our resort is operating smoothly at all times.
					
					<h2>Environmental Responsibility</h2>
					Adventure is our number one focus, but that doesen't mean we ignore our responsibility to protect the environment.
